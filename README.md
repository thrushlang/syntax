# Thrush Programming Language | Syntax

> [!WARNING]  
> The compiler updates faster than this repository, so not everything can be compiled by the current compiler. This is speculative.

This repository contains detailed and general information about the syntax; it is not documentation as such; it is intended to guide you in developing the compiler and the language.

## Content

- ``assembler/`` Information about pure assembler-type functions and assembler values ​​treated as conventional expressions.
- ``attributes/`` Attributes are compile-time code generation modifiers that can modify the behavior of code at runtime.
- ``builtins`` Built-in functions are functions that are part of the compiler and the language; they are like intrinsic to programming languages. 
- ``casts/`` Compile-time type transformation.
- ``structure`` Traditional structures in programming languages.
- ``constants/`` Traditional constants.
- ``enum/`` Traditional enum.
- ``loops/`` Traditional loops in programming languages, such as `for`, `while`, and `loop {}` like Rust.

- ``types/`` Native and primitive types of language.
- ``variables/`` Types of variables and their mutation.

- ``deref/`` High-level pointer dereferencing system ``mut T`` and raw pointers ``ptr[T]``, or ``ptr``.
- ``lli/`` Low-level instructions, explicit memory allocation, overwriting of memory values, loading memory, and calculating memory indexes into pointers.
